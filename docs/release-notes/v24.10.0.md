## DOCA Platform Framework v24.10.0

This is the first release of DOCA Platform Framework.

### Features

- Extends K8S API to manage DPUs and DPU services in a declarative manner.
- Automated discovery, provisioning and configuration of Bluefield DPU devices.
- Alignment between DPU components - firmware, OS, DOCA and DPU services.
- Lifecycle management between the host and its DPU.
- DPU service orchestration - including installation, upgrades and deletion.
- Service function chaining for DPU services running on DPF-provisioned DPUs.
- DPU services supported:
    - OVN-Kubernetes with OVS offload to the DPU.
    - [Host Based Networking](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/nvidia+doca+hbn+service+guide/index.html)
    - [DOCA Telemetry Service](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/nvidia+doca+telemetry+service+guide/index.html)
    - [DOCA Blueman](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/nvidia+doca+blueman+service+guide/index.html)

### Dependencies

#### DPU hardware and software

- DPUs are Bluefield-3.
- DPUs are provisioned with BFB with DOCA version 2.5 or higher to support DPF provisioning.
- BFBs provisioned by DPF will use DOCA version 2.9.
