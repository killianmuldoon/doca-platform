# DOCA Platform Framework (DPF)

## System requirements

Before deploying DPF, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- [DPF System Setup Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)
- [Host Network Configuration Prerequisites](host-network-configuration-prerequisite.md)

## Use cases

DPF enables a range of deployment scenarios by combining specific DPU services into service chains. These chains provide flexibility and efficiency for complex networking workflows. 

Each service combination may require tailored configurations on the DPU for optimal performance. Below are the validated use cases with corresponding deployment guides.

### HBN and OVN
