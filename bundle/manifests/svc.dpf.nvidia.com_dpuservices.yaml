                              The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
                              can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                              Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                              This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                              Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                              Default value is 0.
                              Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                              that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                              can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                              The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                              pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                              on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                              reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                              pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                              Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                              daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                              so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                              cause evictions during disruption.

                              can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                              starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                              up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                              it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                              70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                              the update.
